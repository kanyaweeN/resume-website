 * const [version, reload] = useReducer((n: number) => n + 1, 0);
 * const items = useClientValue(() => loadJSON("items", NONE), NONE, version);
 * // after writing: reload()
 * ```
 *
 * For plain state that lives in localStorage, prefer `useLocalStorage` — it also
 * syncs across tabs. This hook is for values with their own read path (a repository
 * module, a derived count, a media query read once).
